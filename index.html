        <h2>Dreaming of Stones</h2>
        <p><i>Tags: dreams, sleep, insights</i></p>
        <p>Recently, I've been trying out a new tactic to try to help myself fall asleep: counting stones. Normally, we count sheep to fall asleep - my problem is that I think sheep are fascinating animals, so this really doesn't help me. However, I think we can all agree that stones are boring (sorry, geologists) - so I've been counting stones instead!</p>

        <h2>The trolley problem</h2>
        <p><i>Tags: philosophy</i></p>
        <p>I came across the Trolley Problem recently. I found it deeply troubling... why is it called 'the Trolley Problem' when it's actually about trains?</p>
